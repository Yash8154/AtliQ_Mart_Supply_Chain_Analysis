## 🧠 Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a Gujarat-based FMCG company operating in **Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara**, aiming to expand into Tier 1 cities. However, multiple **key customers didn’t renew contracts** due to poor delivery service.

> Management suspects two root issues:
> - Orders not being delivered **on time**
> - Orders not being delivered **in full**

The supply chain analytics team was tasked to **track daily service performance** using 3 core metrics:

- 📍 **OT%**: On-time delivery
- 📍 **IF%**: In-full delivery
- 📍 **OTIF%**: Orders delivered both on time and in full

The goal is to spot issues quickly and **prevent further customer churn** before expanding operations.

## 🎯 Project Goals

As the analyst (roleplay: **Peter Pandey**), I was tasked to:

- Design a **KPI dashboard** using stakeholder inputs
- Track delivery metrics across cities, customers, and products
- Compare **actual performance vs target**
- Highlight underperformance visually and provide insights

## 📊 Metrics Tracked

| KPI     | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **OT%** | Orders delivered on or before the agreed date |
| **IF%** | Orders delivered with complete quantity |
| **OTIF%** | Orders delivered both on time and in full |
| **LIFR%** | Line Item Fill Rate |
| **VOFR%** | Volume Fill Rate |
| **ADDD** | Average Days of Delivery Delay |

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
